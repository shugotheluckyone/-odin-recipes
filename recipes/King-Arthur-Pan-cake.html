    <p>This is a cake I made when I needed to bring a vegan dish to a party.</p>
    <Em>Ingredients</Em>    
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (180g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 cup (198g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (21g) unsweetened cocoa, Dutch-process or natural*</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon espresso powder, optional</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (14g) cider vinegar or white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (67g) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup (227g) water, cold</li>
    </ul> 
        <strong>For Icing</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (255g) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (113g) half-and-half</li>
        </ul>
        <Em>Steps</Em>  
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease an 8" square or 9" round pan that's at least 2" deep.</li>
    <li>Whisk the dry ingredients together in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk the vanilla, vinegar, vegetable oil, and water in a separate bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients, stirring until thoroughly combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. </li>
    <li>Bake the cake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. </li>
    <li>Serve the cake right from the pan; warm from the oven, it's wonderful with a big glass of milk. </li>
    <li>Or, once cool, frost the cake with this simple chocolate frosting: Heat the chocolate chips with the half-and-half until the chips melt. Stir until smooth, and pour/spread over the cake. For a non-dairy icing, substitute 1/3 cup cold brewed coffee (or water) for the half-and-half. </li>
    <li>Store cake, well covered, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage. </li>
  </ol>
